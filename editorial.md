### Content Editing View

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/create-blog.png"/></a>

Brightspot boasts an intuitive UI experience, coupled with a toolset tailored for the professional publisher. Rich text editing, WYSIWYG formatting and inline image editing allows the editor complete manage assets quickly and efficiently.

The beauty of the platform is the manner in which it is tailored to suit each client’s specific requirements. Assets are defined and created with exact structure and terminology, and the UI is automatically generated from your requirements.

### Roles & Permissions 

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/users_roles.png"/></a>

Complete control of new user creation, role definitions and access levels is granted from within Brightspot with a Platform Administrator tool designed to make the often complex job of defining access as easy as possible


### Finding Content

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/find-blog.png"/></a>

Within Brightspot the global search functionality gives the user immediate insight into all assets, providing filters, and relevancy sorting, so each keystroke has an impact on them driving to the right asset, or useable content.

A tailored instance of Brightspot will cater to the business requirements of the client, allowing search filters to be optimized for best usage.

### Module Control

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/modules-changing.png"/></a>

Beyond creating new content, a truly great editorial experience must provide the tools needed to keep that content maintained, and updated. The Brightspot platform facilities drag and drop reordering and the dynamic changing of content within modules. The above view shows how a page lead module, with featured projects, can be easily added to, or customized.

### Template Tool

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage-template.png"/></a>

Layout changes are handled with a template tool interface, providing editors a means to swap content directly, or reposition it on their pages. Any changes made reflect immediately, removing any wait time between adding new modules, and having them appear on the site.


### Inline Content Editing

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/bookmarklet.png"/></a>

The Brightspot Bookmarklet tool brings the same CMS Editorial interface to the front-end of your website. Browse your site visually and access the Bookmarklet tool to overlay each module. Click modules to edit inline, or choose to edit-in-full, and redirect back to the main editorial tool. 

Such functionality allows editors working on specific sections of a site to locate content visually, and edit in place.

### Image Editing / Cropping

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/image-editing.png"/></a>

We know that it takes great imagery to make your content unique. Our Image Management and Editing Interface speaks to this importance, allowing Editors a fluid workflow for adding and managing their image and media assets.

Once logged into Brightspot you are brought to the Dashboard. Here you will find common widgets, your navigation to other areas of the CMS, a global search, and access to your admin and settings. 

Let’s explain what these all do:

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboard.png"/></a>

### Tool Hat
The Tool Hat is the black toolbar at the top of the screen. It remains visible on all pages in Brightspot. From here you can access your own User Settings, Log-out, change which site you are viewing if using Multisite and implement the Bookmarklet tool.

The search tool can be accessed from any screen in Brightspot. Simply place your cursor in the search field to get started. Start typing to see the results change.  As a default, all content types are shown in the results, (EG Blog Post, Person, Project, Images, Slideshows) however with customizable options to filter with, using the filters on the left, you can specify exactly what you are looking for.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/search-dash.png"/></a>

### New Module Creation

Found in the search tool, you have the ability to create new content from anywhere within Brightspot. Choose from a drop-down list of existing examples to get started. *(Note: If you want to create a new page, rather than an individual content module, see the Page Builder tool section.)*

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/new-dash.png"/></a>


### Site Map

The Site Map is a hierarchical view of your website content, showing the structure for the entire site. It is used to either find specific content, or to get a better understanding of the various items within each section. 

![Login Screen](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/site-dash.png)

### Recent Activity 

Using the Recent Activity, you can jump to a piece of content that has just been edited, or scroll through all edits made in one day. It can also be used to verify when content was started and finished by a user. You can also adjust results by filtering between just you and other users.

![Login Screen](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/recent-dash.png)

### Page Builder

Create a whole new page using Page Builder. Select from a list of existing templates to get started, each one associated with a specific piece of content. *(Note: For creating a new content module, see New Module Creation, located within the search tool.)*

![Login Screen](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/page-dash.png)

### Schedules

Content that is set to go live at a future date appears in the Schedules section. Scheduling is set from within the content edit screen, which we will look at later.

![Login Screen](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/schedule-dash.png)

### Drafts

All content that is not yet completed, but saved in a draft status, appears in the Drafts module.

### Creating Content

For the following publisher tasks, we will be using a Demo BrightSpot instance, that powers a mock version of the Perfect Sense Digital Website. Your BrightSpot interface will not share all of the same items, but these examples should give you an understanding of how to carry out basic editorial tasks.

__Goal:__ _Create a new blog post, and publish it._

We are going to start by creating a new a blog post, which will update the Blog Page. From the Dashboard we select ‘Blog Post’, found in the Page Builder section on the right. 

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/select-blog.png"/></a>

This will bring you to the new publication screen.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/create-blog.png"/></a>

There are lots of options here, but for now, let’s focus on creating our first piece of content.

* We enter a Title, “Our Latest Blog Post.”
* We then, click into the ‘Body’ section. Notice how a toolbar appears. This is your Rich Text Editor, allowing you to style your content, add images and links.

* We add some sample text for the blog post.

Now we have our content in place,we can make sure it is looking ok by clicking ‘Preview’, located on the right hand side.

This provides a preview of our content positioned on the blog area of the site, and allows us to check and then make edits before the content goes live.

If everything is as it should be we simply close our preview window. The URL is automatically generated, visible in the right rail widget.  The logic at play grabs the headline “Our Latest Blog Post” and creates a URL. Our current headline is too long for our desired URL, so we can select 'Manual' and add item, a simple URL 'demo-blog'. A slash is automatically added before the word demo.

<img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/change-url.png"/>

We’ve added content, checked it and given it a URL – we’re now ready to publish, by clicking ‘Publish’.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/publish-blog.png"/></a>

Notice that a new ‘History’ section appears in the right rail once you click publish. In BrightSpot we archive all versions automatically.

Also, notice the ‘Create Another’ button that appeared in the top green bar.

If you are not ready to publish, you have the option to 'Save as Draft', which saves a version for you to access later.

Our content is now published. Let’s return to the Dashboard by clicking the ‘Pages & Content’ tab.


__Goal:__ _Find your recently created blog post using BrightSpot Search_

Now that content has been published, we can use the search feature to find it. Clicking into the 'Search' field in the top right of the Dashboard page.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/find-blog.png"/></a>

There are several ways in which you can search in BrightSpot. The default list is sorted by Most Recent, you can adjust this in the side filters. You can also search within a specific content type, say Images, Blog Posts or Projects. 

Start typing the name of your content, for us it's our new blog post “Our Latest Blog Post”. Once you have found it, select it so you can make some edits.

#### Finding Modules / Pages

Our website Homepage has three featured projects presented in a dynamic module. If we want to update this module, we have several options on how to locate it.

**1) Find the Module.**

Modules may exist as individual items, with only one instance on the entire website, or with multiple versions. For the Home Page example there is only one instance of the Featured Projects Module. Using the search tool, use the filter to select "HomePage".

![add img](http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/search-dl.png)

Clicking into the Module allows us to edit it. If we want to swap out the IndieWire project for a new client, we can do so easily. Or drag the listed items to change the order.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/dl-view.png"/></a>


**2) Find the page.**

Because there are often multiple versions of a module, on various pages, EG SlideShows, finding the required page, and then narrowing down the module is often a great way to locate content.

Every Static, or One-off page for the website is categorized as a Page within BrightSpot. In the search tool, using the filter, we can specify a list of all Pages. To get a better result, however, we can simply search for the page by name, in this case, Home Page.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/search-homepage.png"/></a>

Clicking on the Home Page brings us to a template view of the page. We can see all the content contained within the page. The Featured Project section has a link to a Default Featured Projects. Clicking on this brings us to that module, allowing us to edit it. 

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage-template.png"/></a>

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/dl-view.png"/></a>

__Goal:__ _Add an image to your content_

In BrightSpot we can add various items to content as 'Enhancements':

Clicking into the 'Body' Section of our content. In the Rich Text Menu look for 'Add Enhancement'

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/empty-enhancement.png"/></a>

Once clicked you will see a grey 'Empty Enhancement' in your article. Click the Edit link to open the find tool. Here you can either select an existing image or slideshow to add within your blogpost. If you want to add a new image or slideshow, you can do that from here also.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/find-image.png"/></a>


Search for an image already in the CMS, or upload a new one. Click on it to select, then scroll down to save. Close your enhancement window, you should now see the grey enhancement area populated with your image name. (You are not going to see the image, just a reference to it. To see the image in place, use the preview tool.)

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/added-enhancement.png"/></a>


Once an enhancement has been added, we can use the same menu to position it within our content. The green arrows offer alignment options, and also allow you to shift the enhancement above blocks of text. To try this out move your image to the very top of the article using the up arrow.

Use the preview tool to view your newly added image in place. If it looks good, exit the preview and click publish.

__Goal:__ _Moving Content within a page using the template tool_

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/web_home.png"/></a>

On our homepage we have three modules directly below the featured projects. They are Contact Us, Latest Blog Posts and Capabilities and Services. We can move these modules to showcase the CMS template tool capabilities, allowing you, the user, to adjust page layout.

Start by finding a page you want to adjust the layout of, we have found the homepage.

You are brought to a template view of the page. We can move modules, or change the content contained within a section. Try moving the  modules using the green arrows, left and right, up or down. Try reordering.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/homepage-template.png"/></a>

Content does not have to be published the moment it is created. With scheduling, you can specify a time and day for when the content should go live.

From the dashboard, find content in the schedules module. We have a Food.com client that is scheduled.

Click into content and notice the right rail shows the reschedule option. The scheduled date is also provided.

If we want to change the date for scheduling, simply click into the calendar view, and select a new date. To publish now, click into the calendar, and in the bottom right, select 'Now'.


<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/reschedule.png"/></a>

### Deleting Content

<img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/publish-delete.png"/>

For every piece of created content, a delete option is available in the right rail. Clicking on Delete removes the content from the CMS. This deletes all versions / histories of the content, so if you are sure you no longer want the content within the CMS click Delete.

### Adding Users, defining Roles

Found in Admin -> Users and Roles, BrightSpot provides a UI interface tool that allows Administrators to add new users, and define their roles.

Create a new user, by default, all new users have all access. The `Current Site` allows users with MultiSite access to define the default site for the user. 

<img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/users-roles.png"/>

Once a user has been created, a `New Role` can be added, with a customizable access setup. In the dropdowns you can choose to limit access to specific types, for example a role can have read only access to an Article. Simple find the object type you want access limited to, and change the check boxes. The `Areas` dropdown controls the top navigation the user sees within the CMS. Giving no access means no Admin access for that role within BrightSpot

<img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/users_roles.png"/>

<img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/add-user.png"/>

### Previewing Content

Content that is being created with a specific URL within BrightSpot has the ability to be previewed in place. This allows the Editor to see what their content will look like alongside already published modules or adverts.

Clicking the `Preview` link in the right rail, under `Publish` shows the previewed content.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/preview-shot.png"/></a>

### Sharing Content

Once in preview mode, a `Share` button is available in the upper left corner. Clicking this produces a new window with the content displayed using a unique URL. This URL contains the `_preview` parameter, and as such is not indexed by search engines, and can be shared with others before the content is published. The URL can have a time limit specified, so it expires.

### Search Engine Optimization

As a default, all content in BrightSpot with a URL assigned has an SEO widget added. This widget can be found at the bottom of the `Content Publication / Edit` screen.

The data added here overrides the default SEO title and description, which is created automatically from the content.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/seo-shot.png"/></a>

### Managing Content History

Content is automatically versioned within BrightSpot. The right rail widget is populate with a new version each time a save or publish is carried out. This allows the user to simply click into an older version to roll-back.


<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/history-new.png"/></a>

Within the yellow banner, which is shown when an older version is being displayed, an `Edit History` link allows the user to label a particular version. Providing a new name will create a new list of Named Histories in the right rail, allowing easier tracking of versions.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/history-name.png"/></a>

### Adding New Content

For content published on a single page, with a URL, the `Page Builder` section on the Dashboard allows quick access for new content creation. For other items of content, such as `Images`, `Slideshows` or perhaps `Authors`, that do not have a dedicated page, new versions can be created using the `Search Tool`.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/new-content-dropdown.png"/></a>

### Add Content inline

When creating content, you have the ability to add new content types, in this example an `Author` inline. If you have an option to select a piece of content, you also have the ability to create a new instance of it, without having to exit the content edit screen.

In the example below we can add a new author right inline.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/new-content-inline.png"/></a>

### Add Images inline

Images can be added inline, allowing you to create your content without exiting to upload new photos. This can be done either through an image drop down, or alternatively, new images can be added as enhancements.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/new-content-image.png"/></a>

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/new-content-enhance.png"/></a>

### References

Found in the right hand rail, the `References` widget provides a list of content that is associated to the currently in view content. This is a useful way to get easy access to associated content, such as images used within a Slideshow, or Article.

<a href="javascript:;" ><img src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/references-module.png"/></a>

When making changes to a piece of content, the references widget provides an insight into where the changes being made will be seen. For example, when updating a slideshow with new images, the references widget allows the user to see on what pages the slideshow is being used.

When publishing content with Brightspot you have the ability to automatically, through a Permalink or manually define the URL for any content associated with a template. You can also set Redirect URLs for other content or paths, as well as Aliases.

As a default, permalinks can be created automatically from the name of the content.

<a href="javascript:;"><img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/simple-url.png" alt="" /></a>

If you wish to use a different URL from the content name, you can change this to Manual.

<a href="javascript:;"><img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/manual-url.png" alt="" /></a>

Redirects for entered URLs should be placed on the content itself. For example below the URL `/brightspot` will bring the user to the `/products/brightspot` page.

<a href="javascript:;"><img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/redirect-url.png" alt="" /></a>

Aliases are also available, allowing multiple URLs to be provided that all correspond to the same content.

<a href="javascript:;"><img class="smaller" src="http://docs.brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com/alias-url.png" alt="" /></a>

### Note about Redirects

If you have content located at a URL, for example `/products` and you wish to redirect that URL to a new piece of content, for example `/products/brightspot` a redirect must be placed on the content for `/products/brightspot` outlining `/products` and the permalink associated with the first content must be removed. A permalink can not exist on content and also work as a redirect on another piece of content.
