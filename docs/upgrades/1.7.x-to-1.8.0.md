Upgrading from 1.7.x to 1.8.0
=============================

GroupID
------------

Maven `groupId` has changed from `com.psddev.cms` to `com.psddev` to
consolidate all infrastructure projects under a single name.

#### Automatic Init


With version 1.8 we have added dynamic source code compilation and class loading support to Dari.

You no longer need to go through the compile, build, deploy, and init cycle, as any change you make to your source code will be immediately visible. For example, if you add a field/getter/setter, that will show up in the CMS without requiring /_debug/init, and the methods will be available in your JSPs right away.

#### Deployment

In order to streamline the CMS deployment process we have bundled the CMS with your web app, so even if you point to a shared database, you should use your local CMS instance at /cms/.

To fully enable the feature, you need to change the PageFilter definition in web.xml (adds dispatcher tags):

    <filter>
       <filter-name>PageFilter</filter-name>
       <filter-class>com.psddev.cms.db.PageFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
       <filter-name>PageFilter</filter-name>
       <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
       <dispatcher>ERROR</dispatcher>
       <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
       <dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>
       <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
    </filter-mapping>
