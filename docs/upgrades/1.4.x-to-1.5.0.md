Upgrading from 1.4.x to 1.5.0
=============================

Most of the changes were in `dari` so please read its
[upgrade instruction](https://github.com/perfectsense/dari/blob/master/docs/upgrades/1.4.x-to-1.5.0.md)
first.

June 27, 2011
-------------

The `cms-fe` project was merged into `cms-db` to simplify dependency management.

*   Change dependency on `com.psddev.cms:cms-fe` to `com.psddev.cms:cms-db`.
*   Change package namespaces:

        perl -pi -e 's/com\.psddev\.cms\.fe/com.psddev.cms.db/g' `find . -name '*.java' -or -name '*.xml' -or -name '*.jsp'`

July 9, 2011
------------

The `AuthenticationFilter` class was renamed to `ToolFilter` as part of
the filter consolidation.

    perl -pi -e 's/AuthenticationFilter/ToolFilter/g' `find . -name '*.java' -or -name '*.xml' -or -name '*.jsp'`

Finally, run `/cms/_debug/init` then `/_debug/init` if you haven't done so
already.
